# Introduction

My name is Daniel and I've been a product owner for SaaS platforms and 3D DCC software for the last ten years. I hold a certificate in UI/UX and am specialized in node-based shaders and geometry creation. I have recently started looking into developing Python bridges between _Cinema 4D, Blender, VUE and PlantFactory_.

To advance this goal and my coding skills, I recently decided to undergo a full-time coding bootcamp. My current focus is on frontend web development using the React framework. I intend to build upon these skills with a backend bootcamp afterwards, probably focusing on Python and/or Java.

**Current skills**:
 - Prototyping, mockups/wireframes
 - HTML, CSS, some bits of Python and C++, HubL
 - 3D rendering
 - Material & shader creation
 - Blender, Cinema 4D, Substance Designer, VUE, PlantFactory, Gaea

**Learning goals**
- Javascript, first and foremost
- How to write modular, scalable and clean code
- How to think like a programmer: acquiring a "developer mindset"
- Common algorithms for common/recurring problems
- Gaining the necessary basic skills for transitioning to backend courses afterwards

# About this repo
This repository is part of my web development frontend coding bootcamp at neue fische and will be filled with coding challenges and learning content from my coaching group across the next three months.
