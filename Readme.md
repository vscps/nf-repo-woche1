Hello,

my name is Daniel and I've been a product owner with a proficiency certificate in UI/UX for SaaS platforms and 3D DCC software for the last ten years. I specialize in node-based shaders and geometry creation in 3D and have recently started looking into developing Python bridges between Cinema 4D, Blender, VUE and PlantFactory.

To advance this goal and my coding skills, I recently decided to undergo a full-time coding bootcamp. My current focus is on frontend web development using the React framework. I intend to build upon these skills with a backend bootcamp afterwards, probably focusing on Python and/or Java.

This repository is part of my coding bootcap at neue fische and will be filled with coding challenges and learning content from my coaching group across the next three months.
