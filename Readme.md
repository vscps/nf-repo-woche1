Hello,

my name is Daniel and I've been a product owner for SaaS platforms and 3D DCC software for the last ten years. I hold a certificate in UI/UX and am specialized in node-based shaders and geometry creation. I have recently started looking into developing Python bridges between Cinema 4D, Blender, VUE and PlantFactory.

To advance this goal and my coding skills, I recently decided to undergo a full-time coding bootcamp. My current focus is on frontend web development using the React framework. I intend to build upon these skills with a backend bootcamp afterwards, probably focusing on Python and/or Java.

This repository is part of my coding bootcamp at neue fische and will be filled with coding challenges and learning content from my coaching group across the next three months.
